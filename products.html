            <p class="mb-0">For my capstone project I was really wanting to think of something not only unique, but something I could use on a frequent basis along with being useful. As I was tending to my snakes, something clicked in my head. I have always used post-it notes stuck to my cages and wrote down when that certain snake has shed and everytime they ate. Perfect! I could create an app to keep track of that for me! All I need to do is have it let me add a snake and edit when it eats or sheds. But I only had four days so I started building the api, then functionality on the front end, and even had enough time left over to add a little bit of styling. The Snake Shack is a data tracker for snake keepers around the world! It's simple to start using too! All you have to do is sign up with a "dummy email"(123@123.com) and you can start adding snakes right away! Just click "add a snake" and enter the required info. To update when they feed just click on "your snake collection", click to view the particular snake and click update snake. And don't worry, if you get rid of a snake you can delete it from your collection so it wont clutter things up. Enjoy!</p>

            <p class="mb-0">Bobs Bites is a tarantula bite report application where people can view bite reports or if you have been bitten by a tarantula or tarantulas can log the details of the bite. Lets hope you never have to make your own report but if you do or just want to view others bites just sign up with a "dummy email"(123@123.com) and click view reports or start report and fill in the required info. If there are any lasting effects don't worry, you can edit the bite info to add any extra info if needed. </p>

            <p class="mb-0">My very first project at General Assembly was a front end application with my own rendition of the classic tic-tac-toe. For this application I used Javascript and a good amount of jquery to make everything work. It had its challenges trying to figure out the logic of who wins or not but I feel I added a nice creative touch to show you who wins and loses. If you want to give it a shot in your browser just sign up with "dummy data" like (notyourreal@email.com), then sign in with the "dummy data" and start your game. Don't worry, you dont have to keep track of finished games. The app does that for you. Enjoy!</p>
